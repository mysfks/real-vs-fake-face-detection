# CNN Model for Image Classification

This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of the CNN using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset to classify images, and the performance is evaluated using various metrics.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following key sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, and preprocessing steps such as normalization and augmentation are applied.
2. **Model Building**: A CNN model is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras, with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
3. **Training the Model**: The model is trained on the training data, and the performance is monitored using validation data.
4. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the test data, and metrics such as accuracy and loss are plotted.
5. **Results Visualization**: The training and validation losses, as well as the accuracy, are visualized over epochs to analyze the model's performance.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.12.0
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Running the Notebook
1. **Clone this repository to your local machine.**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cnn-image-classification.git
```

2. **Clone this repository to your local machine.**
```bash
cd cnn-image-classification
```

3. **Clone this repository to your local machine.**
